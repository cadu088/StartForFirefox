This is a simple start tab for faster and more accurate use in your search, the "MODE" that is below the search tab and covers redirect to sites like Facebook, Linkeding, Youtube, among others... but if you want do a simple search you will succeed without even using “MODE”.
Configured thinking about the best usability of the search bar, these tabs are still being tested, but with the White mode it is native Black.

How to use "Search":
As with other search tabs, just write your survey and you will search on google, if you have not chosen “MODE” for your search.

How to use "MODE":
To use the “advanced search mode” only thing you have to do is type in the initial of the website and you will be redirected with your search.
Ex: Y = Youtube, L = Linkeding, F = Facebook, G1 = G1 News, among others
Note: if you want to add new search modes, you can add them right here, any improvement is welcome


NOTE: program for Firefox but probably works on others... Enjoy the search mode and any changes are free to add it. See you soon :)
